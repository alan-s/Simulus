# Simulus

A traffic simulator, combining cellular automata with continuous
space models, written in Java, and using the JavaFX framework for visulation.

This code is a fork from [leorohr/7ccsmgpr_2015](https://github.com/leorohr/7ccsmgpr_2015) where it was originally hosted but where the contents no longer remain.

The work was completed as part of a group project in postgraduate Masters course at King's College London, with an associated paper titled *'Combining Cellular Automata with Continuous Space Models in Traffic Simulation'*.

The contributors and sole authors of this work are [team_simulus/members](https://github.com/leorohr/7ccsmgpr_2015/blob/master/team_simulus/members.txt).

**Features**
- Individual vehicle simulation
- Diverse vehicle behaviours
- Vehicle entrance & exit
- Vehicle tagging by behaviour and speed
- Simulation statistics and exporting as csv
- Traffic management policies
- Emergency services vehicles
- User-defined maps and map editor
- Import/export of maps and Settings

## Why

I was curious to revist the project, and having spent several hours fixing deprecated code, and not being able to get Ant build working, I thought I'd upload a working version for anyone else interested in this domain.
